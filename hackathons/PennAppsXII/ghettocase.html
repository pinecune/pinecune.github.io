    <div class="title">The Story</div>
    <p>After assembling my new desktop PC, I felt bad about decomissioning my old one.  I decided to gut some old components from it and make a portable PC that I could take to LAN parties.  Unfortunately, no cases on the market satisfied my vision of small and those cases that came close were out of my budget.  Fortunately, I had access to a workshop where I had the tools to make my own.  I started building during the very relaxing period of Finals Week and spent only about $25, 17 man hours, and one letter grade to bring it to completion.  Finals period can't melt steel dreams.</p>
    
    <div class="title">The Result</div>
    <p>I wish I had more pictures of the design and manufacturing process, but as it was finals period, I didn't spend any time to record my struggle.  Instead, I have a few intermediate progress pictures.  I've uploaded them into an album below.  For what it's worth, I'm happy with the product.  It does what I need it to do, which is play DotA2 and store movies.</p>
