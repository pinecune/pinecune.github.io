    <p>I contributed to Condensation at the Winter PennApps 2015 which was my first hackathon.  I was part of a team of four and I was thrown into something completely new.  There's the whole yada yada about how exciting it was to learn something outside of the classroom, but the biggest thing I took away from it was the reminder that there's a whole world of computer science beyond what I know from my experiences.  There is a real excitement to forging a path into something unkown.  Five minutes ago, I had no idea that you could program command line commands in Ruby, and yet here I was, coding some up for our project.  I was introduced to the wonder and enigma that is GitHub.  I had a blast programming, eating, and being nerds with my friends.</p>
    
    <div class="title">The Project</div>
    <p>The idea behind our project is that there are many different cloud storage services, but they only offer so much storage space.  Thanks to the wealth of APIs that were offered from these services, we were able to construct a program that would take a file, break it up into smaller files, and distribute these broken down files to the different storage services.</p>
    <p>For me, this was an exercise in quickly understanding and deploying various application APIs and trying to combine them all into one coherent program.  Since there were so many APIs we had to deal with, at time, it was frustrating to debug our code, as each service had its own peculiarities.  In the end, though, we were able to combine the powers of each storage service and expand our reach to the stars above.</p>
