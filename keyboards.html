    <div class="title">Why do you do this</div>
    <p>Really, these two keyboards are only useful for DotA2.  One of them isn't really even a keyboard.  But I had never really tinkered with hardware because no computer science class I've taken had had it in the curriculum.  Thanks to the power of the internet, I was able to quickly learn how to solder and program a microcontroller so that I could build my very own keyboard that nobody would ever use.</p>
    
    <div class="title">Big Red</div>
    <p>This was my first project.  It's only one button that presses the key combination "ALT" + "r" (which is the quickcast for a hero's ultimate).  It's really only meant to be played with Techies, but it could easily be programmed to be a key combination for "blink", "cast ultimate" which could be used for heroes like Tidehunter and Earthshaker.  Below are the specs for Big Red.</p>
    <p>I used the Arduino IDE with Adafruit's ATtiny85 addon to program the Trinket.  I copied code from their tutorials on the Trinket Keyboard.</p>

    <div class="title">the Only Key that Matters</div>
    <p>I needed to make a keyboard with the Only Key that Matters for the Only King that Matters: Skeleton King (down with Wraith King).  Since he only has one ability, I really only needed to make a keyboard with "q".  However, I wanted to actually be able to play with this keyboard, so I added my attack, stop, and item keys as well.  I had access to a laser cutter in the workshop, so I used that to cut the frame of my keyboard.  Once the switches and microcontroller were ordered online, I was able to assemble it.  The result is fairly satisfactory and I got some nice experience with soldering in tight spaces.  Below are the specs for the Only Key that Matters.</p>
    <p>I used code from Soarer's Controller and Soarer's Converter to help program the Teensy and I used the Teensy loader to burn the firmware onto the microcontroller.  My job was made easier by the fact that I didn't need to arrange a matrix of switches and I was able to just wire each key to a different pin, as seen in the album below.</p>
