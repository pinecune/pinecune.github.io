    <p>After AP exams, seniors at my high school undertake an Independent Senior Project wherein they pursue some internship or passion.  I didn't want to spend my last month at school working, so I chose an easier route and decided to try to create some 3D models for a game, <a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/project-fate">Project F.A.T.E.</a>, that my friends and I have been working on.  It's a skill that I've always wanted to learn, so I gave it a shot in the month that I had.  Looking back, I actually had a blast and learned a lot.  Below is a slideshow of my journey.</p>
