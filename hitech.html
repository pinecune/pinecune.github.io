    <div class="title">Teaching Computer Science</div>
    <p>In my summer after senior year of high school, I was an asisstant instructor for the <a href="http://www.zatna.com/">Zatna summer camps</a> at the Pingry School.  There, I taught kids ranging from 1st grade to 8th grade.  The program ran for seven weeks with a different course and new students each week.  We taught the younger students using programs like Scratch, Alice.  For the older age groups, we taught an intro course in Python and LEGO robotics.  There was also a course on entrepeneurship where each student would design a product or service, prototype it, and create a website to market it (all theoretically, of course).</p>
    
    <div class="title">The Experience</div>
    <p>Working with children gives you a certain appreciation for where you are now.  For one, there's the Salinger aspect; kids don't carry with them any of the stress of college applications, weight of social drama, or anxiety about the inevitable heat death of the universe.  Teaching grounds you, in a way, because you realize that it was just ten years ago that you were in their shoes.  When they are in yours, where will you be?  Where will the world be?</p>
    
    <div class="title">What's Next</div>
    <p>I will be working again for Zatna as a head instructor in the summer of 2015.  It's definitely not an easy task to handle kids during the summer when they'd undoubtedly rather be playing outside.  Not every student will be receptive, but the interactions with those students who are really fired up about computer science are what makes the whole experience worthwhile.</p>
