    <p>I'm no artist, nor am I a photographer.  Hell, the only thing seperating me from the average Joe with a camera is that my name is not Joe.  But that didn't stop average Joe with a camera, and that's not going to stop me.  I don't have instagram nor do I have a professional photography website, so what amatuer photos I have are just thrown into an album below for your viewing pleasure.</p>
